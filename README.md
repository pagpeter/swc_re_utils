# SWC Starter / Utilities

### Why

This aims to be an example of how to use the latest version of the swc library (as of May 2025),
because many other repositories are either outdated or got taken down due to shady DMCA claims.

### Inspiration & Credits

I have used code & concepts from the following resources:

- https://github.com/manudeobs/turnstile-rs
- https://github.com/leafypout/vercel-anti-bot
- https://steakenthusiast.github.io/

Also thanks to @rsa2048 for some snippets.
